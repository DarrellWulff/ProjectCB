# Captureball
<br>

### Captureball is a 3D team based online multiplayer dodgeball like game made with Unreal Engine with a focus on the usage of Unreal C++.
<br>

### It uses a custom build of Unreal Engine 4.25 that is integrated with the Amazon GameLift C++ Plugin. This Plugin allows for the custom build to communicate with the AWS technologies required to run a dedicated multiplayer game like AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, Amazon Dynamodb, Amazon GameLift Servers, and Flexmatch.
<br>

### Since it was a group project my contribution to Captureball involved setting up the AWS server technologies, coding in C++ the communication to AWS, the Captureball GameMode and gameplay loop management classes, menu and gameplay UI, and to replicate the game management and gameplay code to the dedicated server/client architecture.
